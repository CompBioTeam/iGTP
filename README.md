The sample input gene tree files are also available inside *inputData* folder under iGTP home directory.

The software users' [manual](https://iastate.box.com/s/uufbgyekhc6b450681l4bf82fnaczal9) introduces you to the iGTP system for analysis in evolutionary biology. It explains how to get iGTP running on a computer, and highlights available user interfaces and features of the software.
For simplicity, we also provide execution steps of running iGTP on a sample data set.
